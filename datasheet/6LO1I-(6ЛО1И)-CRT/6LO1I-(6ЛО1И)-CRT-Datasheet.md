Contains no precious metals.

## Non-ferrous metal content

Copper-nickel alloy: 2.6g in joints, in leg pins.

## ATTENTION

When removing parts from the tube, it is necessary to take into account that the flask is located under pressure and its
destruction leads to the scattering of fragments that can cause injuries.

## Acceptance information

Meets the technical specifications of the ODO. 335. 562 TU.

## Quality control stamp

Signature

## Operating instructions

Operation of the tube is permitted in accordance with the instructions and recommendations set out in OST 1! 6556---86.
