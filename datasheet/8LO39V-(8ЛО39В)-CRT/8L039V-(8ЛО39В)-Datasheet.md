## 4 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND OPERATION

* It is not allowed to operate the CRT at the same time with two or more the maximum permissible values of the
  parameters of electrical modes.
* CRTs should be fixed in the equipment using shock-absorbing shims.
* Direct contact of the CRT cylinder with metal parts of equipment.
* When developing electronic equipment, it is recommended to provide watch automatic locking of the electron beam for
  warning CRT failure when the scan generator is not working (at the moment of switching on and turning off electronic
  equipment or in the event of a generator failure, vertices).
* It is recommended to provide for the protection of electronic equipment from short-term CRT breakdowns that do not
  lead to failure.

## 5 STORAGE

Storage of CRTs should be carried out in the manufacturer's packaging or mounted in equipment in heated warehouses at
temperatures from 278 to 313 K and relative humidity up to 80% at a temperature of 298 K.

## FOR INFORMATION

Devices designed to work in countries with a tropical climate, external metal parts are covered with petroleum jelly to
protect against corrosion, and therefore, when putting the devices into operation, you should first remove the layer of
petroleum jelly.
