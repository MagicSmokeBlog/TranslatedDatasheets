* The plane passing through the axis of pin No. 4 and the axis of the tube may deviate from the plane passing through
  the axis of the output of the 3rd anode and the axis of the tube by an angle of 0°±10°.
* The angle between the deviation lines D<sub>1</sub> - D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> - D<sub>4</sub> is 90° ± 3°.
* Plate D<sub>1</sub> is on the same side of the tube as pin #4.
* Plate D<sub>3</sub> is on the same side of the tube as pin #1.
* Deflecting plates D<sub>1</sub> - D<sub>2</sub> (upper) are located closer to the screen, D<sub>3</sub> and
  D<sub>4</sub> (lower) are located closer to the base.
